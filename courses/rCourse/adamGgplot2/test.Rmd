## Intro
This course includes both example code and exercises for you to learn the concepts.   
Before starting, please make sure the following libraries are loaded. If you cannot load a  
library, you probably don't have it, and should use the  `install.packages()` function to 
load them.  

## ggplot2 basics
ggplot2 was devloped by Hadley Wickham, a notable R programmer and contributor to Rstudio.  
The project stable, and should be available for the long term.  
Use http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/ as a reference.  
http://www.r-bloggers.com/ is a collection of recent articles on R.  
To save a plot, use `ggsave`  



```{r}
source("http://bib.umassmed.edu/~wespisea/rCourse/adamGgplot2/answers.R")
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(grid)
library(reshape2)
library(gridExtra)
library(MASS)
library(HistData)
```

Load the datasets...
```{r, echo=FALSE,cache.lazy=TRUE}
boston.epi.df <- read.csv(file = "http://bib.umassmed.edu/~hathawan/rCourse/dataSets/BosEpi.tab.txt",
                          stringsAsFactors=FALSE,
                          sep="\t")
```

\pagebreak  


##Scatter Plots
```{r,fig.width=4,fig.height=3,cache.lazy=TRUE}
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Width,y=Sepal.Length)) + geom_point() 
```
