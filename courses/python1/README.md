Python-Course
=============

Python course material. Notebook files can be convert to HTML using iPython's "nbconvert":

```{bash}
$ ipython nbconvert Session\ I.ipynb
```

For this to work node.js needs to be present.

Anaconda is a free, nice complete package of Python, lots of scientific computing modules, iPython notebook and the Spyder IDE, for Mac, Linux, Windows. This is recommended for people taking the course.
