# Ideas for blog posts on new website:

## Categories:
- python
- unix
- R
- biotools
- stats/data analysis

note: you can have multiple “tags” and categories per article

## Python 2
- topics we didn’t get to:
    - useful python modules:
    - pysam, biopython, etc.
    - better explanation on packages and modules
    - using a RDB instead of a dictionary(map)
    - the conundrum of parallel processing with python (you can do it...but should you?)
    - matplotlib - with ggplot flair
    - virtualenv
    - gzip’ed files
    - pandas!
## Biotools
- bioinformatics in general
    - ??? people interested in diving into how these programs work…??
        - alignment algorithms, burrows wheeler transform, etc. 
- running scripts on the cluster
    - apparently this works: https://gist.github.com/crmackay/6b21a03b299b8a111456
## best practices
- source control (git and github)
- electronic lab notebook
- coding environment (eg “Hi I’m Jill/Arjen/Mike/Nick, and this is how I work”)
